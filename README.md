# Implementation-of-Multivariate-Linear-Regression-Model-for-Sales-Prediction

## AIM:
To write a program to implement the multivariate linear regression model for sales prediction.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
### Step 1: 
Import the required standard libraries such as pandas, matplotlib.pyplot for the
implementation of the multivariate linear regression model for sales prediction.
### Step 2: 
Upload the dataset and check for any null value in the values provided using the
.isnull() function.
### Step 3: 
Declare X and Y variables with respect to the dataset values given by the
'Advertising.csv' file.
### Step 4: 
Predict the values by assigning a variable called y_pred.
### Step 5: 
Using the Mean Square Error (MSE) find the required straight line that fits the data.
### Step 6: 
Print the Mean Square Error(MSE) and R square error.
### Step 7:
 End of the program
